# Deep-Convolution-Generative-Adversarial-Network
Using MNIST Fashion Dataset, I have built a Convolution Neural Network to classify images to 10 different classes.
and I have used DCGAN to generate new images and I have used the same CNN model to classify after combining the new generated images and the old ones then shuffled them and started to classify them.
